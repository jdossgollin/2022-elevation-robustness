## Earth's Future submission

To generate the document tracking changes from `submission_01` to `submission_02`:

```shell
latexdiff papers/earths-future/submission_01.tex papers/earths-future/submission_02.tex > papers/earths-future/trackedchanges_01_02.tex
```

The resulting document probably will not compile and may need some manual adjustments to make it work properly.
