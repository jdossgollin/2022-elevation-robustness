# Things to do or discuss

## To discuss

- Per [AGU style guide](https://www.agu.org/Publish-with-AGU/Publish/Author-Resources/Grammar-Style-Guide#hyphenation), sea level is not hyphenated (as best I can tell)

## To do

- Read and cite

> Katzav, J., Thompson, E. L., Risbey, J., Stainforth, D. A., Bradley, S., & Frisch, M. (2021). On the appropriate and inappropriate uses of probability distributions in climate projections and some alternatives. Climatic Change, 169(1â€“2), 15. <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-021-03267-x>

- Rotate the text Figure 1 to make it easier to read
- Add some explanation text to figure 1
- Where we have things as a proportion of house value, we're currently showing 0.71, 0.85 instead of 71%, 85%.
- Grid sketch: No need to show 2 decimal points for 0 and 1
- Grid sketch: Our yellow dots are not observations. They are sampling locations etc.
- Figure 5B return period: expand to 500 years and consider log scale. Maybe add a third panel showing the probability distribution function (this mght need to be A; [B, C])
- Scenario map: can we translate the color scale to a density?
- SLR priors plot: extend a bit.
