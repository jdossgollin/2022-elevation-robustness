## To do

- Read and cite

-[x] Rotate the text Figure 1 to make it easier to read
-[x] Add some explanation text to figure 1
-[x] Where we have things as a proportion of house value, we're currently showing 0.71, 0.85 instead of 71%, 85%.
-[x] Grid sketch: No need to show 2 decimal points for 0 and 1 *got partway there, good enough*
-[x] Grid sketch: Our yellow dots are not observations. They are sampling locations etc.
-[x] Figure 5B return period: expand to 500 years and consider log scale. Maybe add a third panel showing the probability distribution function (this mght need to be A; [B, C])
-[] Scenario map: can we translate the color scale to a density? *Not very easily*
-[x] SLR priors plot: extend a bit.
