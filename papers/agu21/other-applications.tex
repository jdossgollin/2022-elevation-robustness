    This didactic example illustrates a need for better synthesis and communication of deep uncertainties for decision making.
    \textbf{\scshape let's collaborate on:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item More complex models to capture more relevant metrics
        \item Better priors over nonstationary hazard
        \item Interacting, sequential decisions
        \item Inclusive assessment of ethical questions around scenario weighting
    \end{itemize}

                House elevation is just one of many design problems where nonstationary hazards, subject to scenario and model structure uncertainties, drive outcomes.
