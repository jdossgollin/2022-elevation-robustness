        \item Tailoring guidance to specific building characteristics can improve outcomes
        \item Elevating to ``\gls{bfe} plus a foot'' is not always optimal \cite{xian_elevation:2017,zarekarizi_suboptimal:2020}
        \item Both over- and under-building can be costly \cite{ansar_bigisfragile:2017,DossGollin:2019}
