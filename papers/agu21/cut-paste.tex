Flood elevation is a widely used strategy for managing household flood risk.

        \item[Q1] How to adapt recommendations to a particular house's structure and a particular household's objectives?
        \item[Q2] How to incorporate nonstationary flood risk into decision support and building codes?
        \item[Q3] Which scenarios and model structures should we design for?

\textbf{These issues challenge efforts to incorporate climate change into engineering codes more generally.}
