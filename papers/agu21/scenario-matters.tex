    Any optimal strategy or Pareto frontier is conditional upon an (explicit or implicit) model of future outcomes (see ref.~\cite{gelman_philosophy:2013} for a more philosophical discussion).

    Weights assigned to PDFs or simulations, \textbf{including implicit uniform weights}, should be communicated transparently to facilitate critique and improvement
