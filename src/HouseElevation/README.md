# HouseElevation

This module provides simple helper functions to:

1. Defines a `HouseStructure` with area, structural value, and height (relative to gauge)
1. Defines the height of elevating a given house (as a function of house area and heightening)
1. Defines multiple deterministic depth-damage functions as a function of house structure value and flood depth (relative to gauge)
