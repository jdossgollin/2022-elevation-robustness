    This didactic example illustrates a need for better synthesis and communication of deep uncertainties for decision making.
    \textbf{\scshape let's collaborate on:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item More complex models to capture more relevant metrics
        \item Better models of nonstationary hazards
        \item Interacting, sequential decisions
    \end{itemize}
